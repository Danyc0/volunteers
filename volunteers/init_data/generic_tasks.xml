Buildup is a great task for first-time volunteers, as you will get to know the conference, the volunteers and the staff very well. As a task, it is fairly simple: each year we have to convert five university buildings to a location fit for FOSDEM.

There are many jobs to do: setting up stands, covering the wall with the famous brown paper, running cables, putting up signs, etc. While carrying heavy stuff around is sometimes required, other work requires a more delicate touch.

We usually start at 12:00 and hope to finish before 19:00 (we have to leave the building at 22:00, so that's our deadline). Around that time, someone will bring food for everyone, usually Chinese.

As you can imagine, this is a mammoth task, and more volunteers are always wanted. So if you can't make it at 12:00, come a little later. There will be enough work to do to keep you busy, don't worry!

            Put up all signage. Outside, we place large plastic arrows on poles to guide visitors between buildings.
            Inside, it's paper signs, maps, arrows and anything that could help people to find their way.

        <description>We keep some of our signs inside during the night, to protect them from the elements. Before the
            conference opens, we need to put them up everywhere. As we also have boards with specific (and different)
            content for Saturday and Sunday, these must be changed as well.

            Meet up at the K infodesk.

            We need to leave the premises in a presentable state. Everything we bring and set up must be torn down and removed. All signalization removed, network torn down (go wild; we don't reuse the cables!), tables and chairs stacked so the rental company can load them up when they retrieve them, the floors wiped, ...

Normally we're finished around 9pm, but we stay until we're done.

As many volunteers as possible! That way, it won't take too long. :)

        <description>During the event, we offer visitors a place to leave their coats and luggage. It's usually very
            busy at the start and end of the day; in between it's quite relaxed.

            You take the person's coat and/or luggage or other small items for storage, and pin a ticket with a number
            on it. The other half of the ticket is given to the visitor, so he can reclaim his stuff later.

            Keep things organized: during rush hour you want to be able to find things quickly because rush is hell.

            that's not an issue, AS LONG as you make sure you're covered. Usually the infodesk crew kind of
            self-organises a bit so that it's possible to take a break to go see a talk by making sure there's someone
            to cover you.

            Your tasks will mainly consist of rolling out, neatly securing and crimping UTP cables. People with

        <counter>1</counter>
        <description>Lightning talks are aimed at projects that do not fit in one of the devrooms. Each selected speaker
            gets exactly 15 minutes to present the project or any aspect of it. All the lightning talks happen in a
            large room that can host up to 300 people.

            The lightningtalk schedule is quite busy: https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/lightning_talks/

            Each talk is 15 minutes, with 5 minute breaks in between.


            = Heralding =

            Your task as moderator is to guarantee that the schedule timing is respected. You will also help the
            speakers in setting up their presentation and microphone/pointer, and thank them with a gift at the end of
            the talk. If you wish, you may also briefly introduce each speaker.

            You will also be backup for video.

            Strong points for this task are that you are not afraid to speak to a large audience ( or want to overcome
            it :-) ) and that you like to meet and help different open source developers/speakers. The topics are very
            varied, so it's usually very interesting to moderate.


            = Video =

            Your task as video volunteer is to check if the video's are being recorded correct and if the camera is
            pointed towards the presenter. Ideally, you don't have to touch it and it all work fine.

            You will also be backup for heralding.


            = Speakers =

            The speakers are given the following instructions:

            We have a lot of talks, each allocated a short timeslot. To make this work, it is crucial that there is no
            deviation from the time schedule. The moderator's most important task is to make sure that the time schedule
            is respected. You have to stay focussed on the clock and how much time the speaker has left and give them
            clues.

            To ensure a smooth switch between speakers, please:
            * Attend the lightningtalk before you (= 20 minutes before your talk)
            * There are 5 minute breaks for speaker switches:
            ** You can copy your slides from a USB key onto the presentation PC
            ** You can use your own laptop, but have a fallback on USB
            ** We will give you a microphone and pointer device
            * We will shortly introduce your talk
            * Then, we will set a kitchen timer to exactly 15 minutes

            When the kitchen timer rings, your speaking time is over!

            We will close your talk with a thank you word. You can suggest people with questions to meet you in front.


            = Briefing =

            You will be briefed by the lightningtalk organizer prior to moderation or will be briefed by fellow
            volunteers.
            There will also be sheets available with instructions/reminders.

            = Heralding =

            Your task as moderator is to guarantee that the schedule timing is respected. You will also help the
            speakers in setting up their presentation and microphone/pointer, and thank them with a gift at the end of
            the talk. If you wish, you may also briefly introduce each speaker.

            You will also be backup for video.

            Strong points for this task are that you are not afraid to speak to a large audience ( or want to overcome
            it :-) ) and that you like to meet and help different open source developers/speakers. The topics are very
            varied, so it's usually very interesting to moderate.


            = Video =

            Your task as video volunteer is to check if the video's are being recorded correct and if the camera is
            pointed towards the presenter. Ideally, you don't have to touch it and it all work fine.

            You will also be backup for heralding.


            = Speakers =

            The speakers are given the following instructions:

            We have a lot of talks, each allocated a short timeslot. To make this work, it is crucial that there is no
            deviation from the time schedule. The moderator's most important task is to make sure that the time schedule
            is respected. You have to stay focussed on the clock and how much time the speaker has left and give them
            clues.

            To ensure a smooth switch between speakers, please:
            * Attend the lightningtalk before you (= 20 minutes before your talk)
            * There are 5 minute breaks for speaker switches:
            ** You can copy your slides from a USB key onto the presentation PC
            ** You can use your own laptop, but have a fallback on USB
            ** We will give you a microphone and pointer device
            * We will shortly introduce your talk
            * Then, we will set a kitchen timer to exactly 15 minutes

            When the kitchen timer rings, your speaking time is over!

            We will close your talk with a thank you word. You can suggest people with questions to meet you in front.


            = Briefing =

            You will be briefed by the lightningtalk organizer prior to moderation or will be briefed by fellow
            volunteers.
            There will also be sheets available with instructions/reminders.

        <description>Lightning talks are aimed at projects that do not fit in one of the devrooms. Each selected speaker
            gets exactly 15 minutes to present the project or any aspect of it. All the lightning talks happen in a

        <description>Lightning talks are aimed at projects that do not fit in one of the devrooms. Each selected speaker
            gets exactly 15 minutes to present the project or any aspect of it. All the lightning talks happen in a
            large room that can host up to 300 people.

            The lightningtalk schedule is quite busy: https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/lightning_talks/

            Each talk is 15 minutes, with 5 minute breaks in between.


            = Heralding =

            Your task as moderator is to guarantee that the schedule timing is respected. You will also help the
            speakers in setting up their presentation and microphone/pointer, and thank them with a gift at the end of
            the talk. If you wish, you may also briefly introduce each speaker.

            You will also be backup for video.

            Strong points for this task are that you are not afraid to speak to a large audience ( or want to overcome
            it :-) ) and that you like to meet and help different open source developers/speakers. The topics are very
            varied, so it's usually very interesting to moderate.


            = Video =

            Your task as video volunteer is to check if the video's are being recorded correct and if the camera is
            pointed towards the presenter. Ideally, you don't have to touch it and it all work fine.

            You will also be backup for heralding.


            = Speakers =

            The speakers are given the following instructions:

            We have a lot of talks, each allocated a short timeslot. To make this work, it is crucial that there is no
            deviation from the time schedule. The moderator's most important task is to make sure that the time schedule
            is respected. You have to stay focussed on the clock and how much time the speaker has left and give them
            clues.

            To ensure a smooth switch between speakers, please:
            * Attend the lightningtalk before you (= 20 minutes before your talk)
            * There are 5 minute breaks for speaker switches:
            ** You can copy your slides from a USB key onto the presentation PC
            ** You can use your own laptop, but have a fallback on USB
            ** We will give you a microphone and pointer device
            * We will shortly introduce your talk
            * Then, we will set a kitchen timer to exactly 15 minutes

            When the kitchen timer rings, your speaking time is over!

            We will close your talk with a thank you word. You can suggest people with questions to meet you in front.

        <description>The beer event is (one of) the greatest FOSDEM-side-activities. During Friday night, the Delirium
            Café is ours and we organize a world-famous beer event with equally famous Belgian beers.

            Your role is to separate those who are allowed to enter from those who are not. The café is reserved
            exclusively for FOSDEM use, and while the security knows this, they don't speak English or know what FOSDEM
            is. So your role will be to check whether a visitor is indeed FOSDEM-related, and if so, to stamp their
            wrists in order for them to gain continued entry.

            You'll also be responsible for selling the tokens visitors can buy beer (or other drinks) with.

            Perks of the job are plentiful. You'll meet a great amount of interesting people, have guaranteed access to
            Delirium and we'll ensure your throat never goes dry.

        <description>Not everyone can attend FOSDEM, and even those that attend can't make it to every talk. So, since
            several years we've taken to filming (most of) the talks and putting them on our website for viewing
            afterwards.

            But we can't do it alone. There are lots of rooms to video, and lots of videos to process. Because this task
            is not as easy as it might seem, you will be coached and trained by more experienced volunteers. Your main
            job will be filming the talks in the main track rooms; most of the other stuff will be handled by the Video
            team.

            A complete manual is also available at
            https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/blob/master/instructions/FOSDEM_AV_manual.pdf.

            Please arrive at least 20 minutes early and make your way to the Volunteer desk at the K Infodesk.

        <description>Not everyone can attend FOSDEM, and even those that attend can't make it to every talk. So, since
            several years we've taken to filming (most of) the talks and putting them on our website for viewing
            afterwards.

            But we can't do it alone. There are lots of rooms to video, and lots of videos to process. Because this task
            is not as easy as it might seem, you will be coached and trained by more experienced volunteers. Your main
            job will be filming the talks in the main track rooms; most of the other stuff will be handled by the Video
            team.

            A complete manual is also available at
            https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/blob/master/instructions/FOSDEM_AV_manual.pdf.

            Please arrive at least 20 minutes early and make your way to the Volunteer desk at the K Infodesk.

            this job, you don't have to be on site, but need to be a fluent speaker of English, as you'll have to
            understand all speakers. For most of them, English is not their first or even second language.

            We start on Saturday evening, after all tasks have finished. More information will be provided to you by the
            Video team, but you'll need a decent uplink, web browser and Github account. The software used is Amara

        <description>Not everyone can attend FOSDEM, and even those that attend can't make it to every talk. So, since
            several years we've taken to filming (most of) the talks and putting them on our website for viewing
            afterwards.

            But we can't do it alone. There are lots of rooms to video, and lots of videos to process. Because this task
            is not as easy as it might seem, you will be coached and trained by more experienced volunteers. Your main
            job will be filming the talks in the main track rooms; most of the other stuff will be handled by the Video
            team.

            A complete manual is also available at
            https://github.com/FOSDEM/video/blob/master/instructions/FOSDEM_AV_manual.pdf.

            Please arrive at least 20 minutes early and make your way to the Volunteer desk at the K Infodesk.
